## Changes Made

###[Component Name]

1. useEffect in line 37
   - Issue: useEffect missing dependencies causing stale state
   - Fix: Added required dependencies to useEffect array
2. Accessibility issue with the search icon line 98
   - Issue: search icon is not accessible
   - Fix: Added search icon to the input field

### [Application folder structure]

1. ...
   - Issue: The current codebase has most of it's code in the components folder which makes it hard to navigate.
   - Fix: Use the clean architecture principle which will help separate concerns into presentation, domain, and infrastructure layers. I have the following folders now 
      in the main src folder

### [App.tsx file refactor]
1. File/Component separation
   - Issue: All Components are defined in a single file which is bad practice for scalable apps.
   - Fix: I will split each component on its own file.
2. Naming convention
   - Issue: BoxArea97 and BoxArea108 are unclear and don't describe their purpose
   - Fix: I will rename them for clarity BoxArea97->HeroSearchSection, BoxArea108->SearchInput


### [Header.tsx refactor]
1. Avatar
   - Issue: Avatar Image not appearing on Header
   - Fix: Exported the image from figma to the assets folder, the I used it in the Avatar component.
2. Search Input
   - Issue: Search input not styled correctly.
   - Fix: Styling the search input(pill-shaped, centered icon, correct color)
3. Responsiveness
   - Issue: The search Input wasn't responsive on different screens, it kept displaying on small devices which distorted the ui.
   - Fix: I've used Tailwind's responsive utilities and now the header is responsive.


### [SearchInput.tsx component]
1. Debounce logic
   - Issue: Issue: Every keystroke was triggering onSearch, causing unnecessary re-renders or API calls.
   - Fix: Introduced a reusable useDebounce hook to delay the onSearch callback until the user stops typing.
2. useEffect with stale or duplicated state
   - Issue: Two useEffect hooks were managing innerValue, leading to unnecessary renders and stale values.
   - Fix: Proper dependency management and separation of concerns: one effect sets query from initialValue, and another triggers onSearch using the debounced value.
3. Form handling
   - Issue: There was no form element; pressing "Enter" wouldn't trigger search.
   - Fix: Wrapped input in a <form> with onSubmit to support accessibility and keyboard behavior.
4. Accessibility
   - Issue: The search icon was purely decorative but lacked aria-hidden, and the input field had no label.
   - Fix: Added aria-hidden to the icon and included a visually hidden <label> for screen readers.

### [SearchHero.tsx component]
1. DOM structure
   - Issue: Unnecessary wrapping <div> increased DOM depth.
   - Fix: Removed redundant wrapper to keep DOM clean and maintainable.
2. Accessibility
   - Issue: img tag lacked alt text.
   - Fix: Added alt="Abstract background" to improve accessibility.
   - Issue: No semantic sectioning or ARIA attributes.
   - Fix: Used <section> and aria-label to clarify intent to assistive tech.
3. Maintainability
   - Issue: Layout behavior like mt-6 depends on SearchInput being used in a specific layout context.
   - Fix: Ensured SearchInput controls its own margin/padding.
4. Best Practices
   - Issue: Hardcoded search logic and structure were tightly coupled.
   - Fix: Kept the onSearch logic separate and clean, ready to plug into real search logic later.

### [TagList.tsx component]
1. Missing semantic structure
   - Issue: The component uses only <div> elements, which doesn’t provide semantic meaning.
   - Fix: Replaced the outer container with a <section> and the title with a <h2> to improve accessibility and semantics.
2. Missing aria-label / role
   - Issue: There is no ARIA labeling or landmark role to inform assistive technologies of the list's purpose.
   - Fix: Added aria-label to the <section> to describe the group of tags for screen readers.
3. No keyboard interactivity
   - Issue: Badges are styled as clickable (cursor-pointer) but are not interactive for keyboard users.
   - Fix: Wrapped each tag inside a <button> to make them fully accessible and interactive, with proper semantics.
4. Tag component reusability
   - Issue: If Badge is meant to be purely visual, onClick/cursor-pointer should be avoided unless it's interactive.
   - Fix: Converted to <button> where applicable, or removed cursor-pointer if tags are not meant to be clicked.

### [SearchPage.tsx component]
1. Unnecessary <div> wrapper
   - Issue: The outer <div> serves no semantic or layout purpose.
   - Fix: Removed it to reduce DOM depth.
2. Missing semantic structure
   - Issue: The <main> tag is used correctly, but there's no semantic heading or section grouping for content blocks.
   - Fix: Wrapped tag groups (TagList) in <section>s with proper aria-labels or headings if needed.
