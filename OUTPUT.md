## Changes Made

###[Component Name]

1. useEffect in line 37
   - Issue: useEffect missing dependencies causing stale state
   - Fix: Added required dependencies to useEffect array
2. Accessibility issue with the search icon line 98
   - Issue: search icon is not accessible
   - Fix: Added search icon to the input field

### [Application folder structure]

1. ...
   - Issue: The current codebase has most of it's code in the components folder which makes it hard to navigate.
   - Fix: Use the clean architecture principle which will help separate concerns into presentation, domain, and infrastructure layers. I have the following folders now 
      in the main src folder
         src/

### [App.tsx file refactor]
1. File/Component separation
   - Issue: All Components are defined in a single file which is bad practice for scalable apps.
   - Fix: I will split each component on its own file.
2. Naming convention
   - Issue: BoxArea97 and BoxArea108 are unclear and don't describe their purpose
   - Fix: I will rename them for clarity BoxArea97->HeroSearchSection, BoxArea108->SearchInput


### [Header.tsx refactor]
1. Avatar
   - Issue: Avatar Image not appearing on Header
   - Fix: Exported the image from figma to the assets folder, the I used it in the Avatar component.
2. Search Input
   - Issue: Search input not styled correctly.
   - Fix: Styling the search input(pill-shaped, centered icon, correct color)
3. Responsiveness
   - Issue: The search Input wasn't responsive on different screens, it kept displaying on small devices which distorted the ui.
   - Fix: I've used Tailwind's responsive utilities and now the header is responsive.
